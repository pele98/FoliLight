# FoliLight

### General information

Application is built on React native and expo.

Application uses FÃ¶li's public api to fetch data.

### How to use

With expo installed application can ran locally: 

```
npm install
expo start
```

or application can be installed to phone with the provided .apk file
file can be found on the root folder "built_apks"
If application is installed with apk file, map currently is not working.
This is because google maps api key is missing. Map still works if aplication is ran on expo.
